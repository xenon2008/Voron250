### About me & this Repo:

Hello =)

This is a repo of my <u>Voron 2.4 250mmÂ²</u> which contains some information about the configuration and the mods that I have installed.

Since it is my first Repo on Github, there will surely be other useful stuff here over time i think ðŸ˜…

So please forgive me any initial mistakes here ðŸ˜˜

And what is also worth knowing that my English skills are rather poor. ðŸ™ˆ
So if I should write something wrong, you are welcome to let me know so that I can put it right =)

And since I'm new to Github, and I have to get used to it, you're welcome to give me tips & tricks here as well.ðŸ˜‰

Feel free to Contact me in the [Voron Discord](https://discord.gg/voron) and many other 3D Printing Discords of which I am also a Member under: ***<u>xenon2008#0005</u>***
